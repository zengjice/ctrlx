/// **Layer-backing discipline.** Earlier AppKit attempts left
/// neighbouring SwiftUI surfaces (tab bar, sidebar, the detail-pane
/// viewport itself) in an unrendered state until the next input event.
/// The fix was finding STTextView, which sets `wantsLayer = true` on
/// every view in its hierarchy — when the embedded scroll view shares
/// its parent's layer with sibling SwiftUI views, AppKit's display
/// invalidation propagates to those siblings without triggering a
/// SwiftUI redraw of them. We give every AppKit view here its own
/// backing layer so invalidation stays contained.
///
/// **Update discipline.** All text/highlight/scroll mutations are
/// pushed through a `PlainTextController` from `.task(id: text)` and
/// `.onChange(of: highlightLine)` rather than from `updateNSView`.
/// Highlight is painted in a `drawBackground(in:)` override instead
/// of `addTemporaryAttribute` so there are no layout-manager

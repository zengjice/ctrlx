### How it works

1. **CtrlxE2ECommand** parses CLI args and creates a `TestOrchestrator`
2. **TestOrchestrator** runs scenarios sequentially, executing each `TestStep` via the appropriate driver
3. **Drivers** handle platform interaction:
   - **SimulatorDriver** — boots simulator, installs/launches apps, manages XCUITest runner lifecycle, communicates with it via HTTP for UI inspection, taps, swipes, and text input
   - **MacOSDriver** — launches macOS app, clicks buttons via AppleScript (`osascript`), takes screenshots
   - **ServerDriver** — starts/stops an in-process Vapor server, checks health and pairing state
4. After each scenario, the orchestrator runs **cleanup** (stop XCUITest runner, terminate both apps, stop server) regardless of pass/fail

### XCUITest runner

iOS UI automation uses a separate **XCUITest runner** process running in the Simulator. This replaces the previous in-app accessibility server approach.

The runner is a UI Testing bundle (`CtrlxE2ERunner`) hosted by a minimal app (`CtrlxE2EHost`). It exposes an HTTP server on port 22087 with endpoints for:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/status` | GET | Health check |
| `/viewHierarchy` | POST | Full UI tree via `XCUIElement.snapshot().dictionaryRepresentation` |
| `/touch` | POST | Tap at (x,y) via synthesized touch events |
| `/swipe` | POST | Swipe gesture via synthesized touch events |
| `/inputText` | POST | Type text via daemon proxy |
| `/customAction` | POST | Trigger named accessibility action on an element |
| `/screenshot` | POST | Capture screenshot |

The runner uses XCTest private APIs (`XCSynthesizedEventRecord`, `XCPointerEventPath`, `XCTRunnerDaemonSession`) for touch synthesis and `XCUIElement.snapshot()` for privileged, complete view hierarchy access. This gives it visibility into confirmation dialogs, system alerts, and other UI elements that an in-app server cannot see.

The `SimulatorDriver` manages the runner lifecycle:
1. Installs the host app via `xcrun simctl install`
2. Starts the runner via `xcodebuild test-without-building`
3. Polls `/status` until responsive
4. Sends the target app's `bundleId` in requests so the runner inspects the correct app
5. Kills the runner process on cleanup

### Storage isolation

Both apps accept `--e2e-test` as a launch argument. When present, `prepareDependencies` (swift-dependencies) overrides `PreferencesService` and `SecretsService` with in-memory implementations. This prevents E2E tests from writing to real UserDefaults or Keychain.

### Tmux socket isolation

The macOS app accepts `--tmux-socket <path>` (alongside `--e2e-test`) to use a dedicated tmux server socket instead of the system default. This prevents E2E tests from polluting the developer's real tmux sessions. The default socket path is `/tmp/ctrlx-e2e.sock`. During cleanup, the orchestrator kills the isolated tmux server and removes the socket file.

### Plugin state isolation

Sidecar plugins are staged (`macStageSidecarFixture`) or installed (`ctrlx plugin install`) into the app's `~/.ctrlx` tree, which E2E redirects under a shared per-suite base via `--ctrlx-state-root`. The folder-dropped/installed bundles live in `<base>/plugins/<id>` and the installed-plugin registry in `<base>/registry.json` — both **siblings** of the per-scenario `<base>/<idx>` state root. During cleanup the orchestrator wipes this shared plugin state (`plugins/`, `registry.json`, and the E2E `zip-fixtures/` staging dir) too, so a plugin staged or installed by one scenario cannot leak into a later scenario that opens Settings → Agents. Each scenario re-stages what it needs at launch, keeping plugin state deterministic and independent of scenario order (issue #690).

### Shell history isolation

Shells spawned in E2E panes never write to the developer's `~/.zsh_history`. The orchestrator maintains a `$ZDOTDIR` shim directory (`<TMPDIR>/ctrlx-e2e-zdotdir`) whose zsh startup files source the user's real dotfiles — so the shell behaves exactly like a normal one — and then unset `HISTFILE` after the user's rc has run. A plain `HISTFILE=` env var wouldn't work: macOS's `/etc/zshrc` reassigns `HISTFILE` after tmux applies the pane environment.

The shim reaches both spawn paths: orchestrator-created sessions get `-e ZDOTDIR=<shim>` on `new-session` directly, and app-created panes get it via the `--zdotdir <shim>` launch argument, which the composition root forwards to `TmuxService.zdotDirOverride`. The shim path is deliberately stable (shared across instances and runs) so zsh's `.zcompdump-*` completion cache is reused. Side effect: commands you type into panes during `--interactive` sessions aren't recorded either. Verified end-to-end by the "Terminal Env Vars" scenario.

### Variable interpolation

Steps can pass data between each other via `ExecutionContext`. Use `macReadClipboard(storeAs: "key")` or `storeValue(key:value:)` to store, and `"${key}"` in any string argument to reference it. The orchestrator resolves variables before passing to drivers.

## Running tests

### Using the script (recommended)

```bash
# Build everything and run all scenarios
./scripts/e2e-test.sh

# Skip build, just run tests with previously built artifacts
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --skip-build

# Run a specific scenario
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --scenario "Fresh Pairing"
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --skip-build --scenario "Unpair from iOS"

# Run with a specific simulator
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --sim-name "iPhone 16 Pro"

# Other options
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --screenshots /path/to/dir

# Interactive mode: launch all apps and wait (no pairing)
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --skip-build --interactive

# Interactive mode: run a scenario then wait
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --skip-build --interactive --scenario "Fresh Pairing"

# List available scenarios
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --skip-build --list-scenarios

# Custom tmux socket path
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --tmux-socket /tmp/my-test.sock
```

The script builds four targets: CtrlxServer (macOS), Ctrlx (iOS), CtrlxE2EHost (build-for-testing), and CtrlxE2E (CLI coordinator).

### Running manually

Build all targets first, then:

```bash
CtrlxE2E \
    --ios-app-path /path/to/CtrlX.app \
    --macos-app-path /path/to/CtrlX.app \
    --sim-name "iPhone 17 Pro" \
    --screenshots-dir /tmp/e2e-screenshots \
    --baselines-dir ./E2ETests \
    --tmux-socket /tmp/ctrlx-e2e.sock \
    --e2e-runner-path /path/to/derived-data
```

The `--e2e-runner-path` points to the derived data directory from `xcodebuild build-for-testing` of the `CtrlxE2EHost` scheme. It contains the `.xctestrun` file and host app needed to start the XCUITest runner.

### Running a specific scenario

```bash
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --scenario "Fresh Pairing"

# Or manually:
CtrlxE2E --scenario "Fresh Pairing" ...
```

### Prerequisites

- Xcode with iOS Simulator installed
- The simulator named in `--sim-name` must exist (`xcrun simctl list devices available`)
- Accessibility permissions for Terminal/IDE (System Settings > Privacy > Accessibility)
- `xcsift` installed (`brew install xcsift`) for build output filtering
- **macOS 15+ Local Network:** the app no longer does a blocking local-network call at startup, so a fresh machine runs without a Local Network prompt. (If you ever do see CtrlX hang at launch with a "find devices on your local network" prompt, allow it once in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Local Network and re-run.)

## Recording runs as video (`--record`)

`./scripts/e2e-test.sh --record` records each scenario as ONE full-display
take (issue #621): ScreenCaptureKit captures the main display at ≤15 fps / 1x,
started on `scenarioStarted` and finalized on `scenarioCompleted` (success or
failure) by `RecordingCoordinator`, a `TestProgressReporter`.

- **Stage layout:** with `--record`, the orchestrator translates instance-N
  `macMoveWindow` / `macClickAtPoint` / `macDrag` coordinates into a per-
  instance screen lane (side-by-side on wide displays, staggered diagonal on
  laptops) so multi-instance scenarios are visible in one frame. Windows are
  MOVED, never resized — baselines are unaffected. The Simulator window is
  pinned top-right. Instance 0 is never touched.
- **Post-processing:** `e2e_video_postprocess.py` (bundled resource) burns a
  step-caption ribbon + a real-elapsed timecode on the 1x timeline, then
  compresses static spans > 0.5s (`--record-mode speedup` (default, visible
  `>> 8x` badge) or `remove`). Requires `brew install ffmpeg-full` — the slim
  `ffmpeg` formula dropped the `drawtext`/`ass` filters, and `ffmpeg-full` is
  keg-only so its bin must be on `PATH` (`export
  PATH="$(brew --prefix ffmpeg-full)/bin:$PATH"`). Gated by
  e2e-test.sh. `--record-keep-raw` keeps `recording-raw.mov` for timing
  disputes (the published video is retimed; the burned-in timecode is the
  wall-clock reference).
- **Artifacts** per scenario dir: `timeline.json` (raw step offsets),
  `video.mp4`, `video.json` (published duration + remapped seek chapters).
  `e2e-report.sh` stores the video content-addressed (`images/<sha>.mp4`) and
  embeds a `video` field in `report.json`; the CtrlxTestResults viewer
  plays it with clickable step-seek chapters.
- **Caveats:** records the whole desktop — prefer CI VMs over personal
  machines; incidental system UI can appear; occlusion is minimized, not
  guaranteed zero, on small displays. Recording every scenario adds ~GBs per
  full run to the results repo — keep it opt-in.

### Attaching a video to a PR (`e2e-attach-video.sh`)

Set `RESULTS_REPO=OWNER/results` (or pass `--results-repo OWNER/results`) before
uploading or fetching named assets. There is no default upstream repository.
Local files and full release URLs remain usable without this setting.

`./scripts/e2e-attach-video.sh "Scenario Name"` uploads a recorded scenario's
`video.mp4` as an asset on the configured results repo's rolling `e2e-videos`
prerelease (official `gh release upload` API — no repo history, no
undocumented endpoints) and posts a PR comment linking it. Video proof that a
feature works, discardable after review:

```bash
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --record --scenario "Window Description Sync"
./scripts/e2e-attach-video.sh "Window Description Sync"   # PR auto-detected
```

Accepts multiple scenarios (one comment), scenario names / dir names / video
paths, `--pr N` when off the PR branch, `--message TEXT` to replace the
comment's intro line with what the videos prove (markdown), and `--no-comment`
to just upload and print the markdown snippet. For two takes of the *same*
scenario (a bug-fix repro pair), `--label failing` / `--label passing` suffixes
the asset name and link title so the uploads don't clobber each other — attach
each take before re-recording, since a new run overwrites the local
`video.mp4`. Assets are named `pr<N>-<scenario-dir>.mp4`
(re-runs clobber), use the configured bot when `BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, and are
deletable any time: `gh release delete-asset e2e-videos <asset>.mp4 --repo
"$RESULTS_REPO"`. Note: release-asset links download rather
than play inline, and require access to the (private) results repo — use
`e2e-watch-video.sh` (below) to watch one in the browser.

### Watching a video (`e2e-watch-video.sh`)

`./scripts/e2e-watch-video.sh TARGET [TARGET ...]` plays an uploaded proof
video inline in the browser: it resolves the asset's short-lived signed URL
(~1 hour) with your `gh` credentials and opens the static player page
`scripts/e2e-video-player.html` with the URL in the fragment (media loads are
no-cors, so the private asset plays and seeks even though pages can't
`fetch()` it). Each TARGET is an asset name (`pr626-foo[.mp4]`), a
release-asset download URL, a local video file / scenario dir (opened
directly), or a scenario name (`--pr N`, defaulting to the current branch's
PR). `--results-repo` / `--release-tag` override the defaults, as with the
attach script. The attach script's PR comments include a copy-pasteable
`watch:` hint per video with the upload's repository and release tag, so the
command does not depend on the viewer's `RESULTS_REPO` environment variable.

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-e2e-watch-video-design.md`.

### Automatic cleanup (`e2e_video_cleanup.py`)

The `.github/workflows/e2e-video-cleanup.yml` workflow sweeps daily: assets
whose PR merged or closed more than 3 days ago are deleted, and the PR comments
that linked them are edited (links struck through, deletion note appended) so
nobody clicks dead links. Open — including reopened — PRs are skipped; asset
names not matching `pr<N>-*.mp4` are left alone. Needs the `RESULTS_REPO_TOKEN`
secret (fine-grained PAT, Contents read/write on the configured results repo only)
and the `RESULTS_REPO` repository variable. The job is skipped until that variable
is configured; PR lookups target the current GitHub repository using its workflow
token. Also runs locally:

```bash
./scripts/e2e_video_cleanup.py --repo OWNER/ctrlx --results-repo OWNER/results --dry-run
```

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-e2e-video-cleanup-design.md`.
Unit tests: `python3 scripts/tests/test_e2e_video_cleanup.py`.

## Writing scenarios

### Basic scenario

Create a new file in `CtrlxE2ELib/Scenarios/`:

```swift
import Foundation

public enum MyScenario {
    public static let scenario = CtrlxE2ELib.scenario(
        "My Scenario",
        tags: ["mytag"]
    ) {
        TestStep.startServer
        TestStep.verifyServerHealth

        TestStep.launchIOSApp
        TestStep.iosWaitForElement(.labelContains("some text"), timeout: 10)
        TestStep.iosScreenshot(label: "my-screenshot")

        TestStep.launchMacApp
        TestStep.wait(seconds: 2)
        TestStep.macScreenshot(label: "mac-screenshot")
    }
}
```

The orchestrator builds launch arguments automatically:
- `startServer` uses a fixed port (8765)
- `launchIOSApp` passes `--e2e-test --server-url ws://127.0.0.1:8765`
- `launchMacApp` passes `--e2e-test --server-url ws://127.0.0.1:8765 --tmux-socket <path>`

The server URL is always included (even for macOS-only scenarios without a running server) to prevent accidental connection to production.

### Composing scenarios

Scenarios can include other scenarios. Their steps get flattened inline:

```swift
public enum AdvancedScenario {
    public static let scenario = CtrlxE2ELib.scenario(
        "Advanced Test",
        tags: ["advanced"]
    ) {
        // All pairing steps run first
        FreshPairingScenario.scenario

        // Then additional steps with both apps paired and running
        TestStep.iosTap(.label("New Session"))
        TestStep.wait(seconds: 2)
        TestStep.iosTap(.labelContains("New Terminal"))
    }
}
```

Scenarios should **not** include cleanup steps (terminate apps, stop server) — the orchestrator handles that automatically after each scenario.

### Registering a scenario

Add it to the **end** of the `allScenarios` array in `CtrlxE2ECommand.swift`:

```swift
private static let allScenarios: [TestScenario] = [
    FreshPairingScenario.scenario,
    NewTerminalScenario.scenario,
    // ... existing scenarios ...
    MyScenario.scenario,  // always add new scenarios at the end
]
```

New scenarios can be added anywhere in the list. Baseline directories are named after the scenario description (sanitized to lowercase with hyphens), not by position.

### Verifying a new scenario

Always run the new scenario and confirm it passes before committing:

```bash
./scripts/e2e-test.sh --scenario "My Scenario"
```

If the scenario fails, fix the issue and re-run until it passes. Never commit a failing e2e test.

Scripts live in `CtrlxE2ELib/Scenarios/Scripts/` as plain files (Python, shell, etc.). They are bundled as SPM resources and copied to `$TMPDIR` at runtime. Reference them in tmux commands as `$TMPDIR/<name>`. Cleanup is automatic, even on test failure.

### General

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `wait(seconds:)` | Sleep for a duration. **Avoid** when a state-driven wait works — see [Avoid redundant waits](#avoid-redundant-waits) below. |
| `storeValue(key:value:)` | Store a literal value in the execution context |
| `log(_:)` | Log a message (supports `${variable}` interpolation) |

### Avoid redundant waits

Fixed `wait(seconds:)` calls compound across the scenario suite and are the biggest single source of slow E2E runs. The `*WaitFor*` family of steps (`iosWaitForElement`, `iosWaitForElementToDisappear`, `macWaitForElement`, `macWaitForElementQuery`, `macWaitForWindow`, `macAssertWindowTitle`, `waitForHostConnected`, `waitForViewerConnected`, `waitForNoPairings`, `verifyServerHasPairings`, `waitForTmuxDisplayMessage*`, `waitForFileContains`) already poll until the condition is satisfied or the timeout expires, so a fixed `wait` directly before them is always redundant and should be removed.

`iosTap` and `macClickButton` also have a 5-second internal element wait, so a `wait` before them is almost never useful.

Two anti-patterns to watch out for:

1. **`waitForElementToDisappear` as a "loading finished" signal.** If the element hasn't appeared yet when the check runs, `waitForElementToDisappear` returns immediately — and the test continues before the loading has actually started. Instead, wait for an element that only exists in the post-loaded state:

   ```swift
   // ❌ may return immediately if spinner hasn't shown yet
   TestStep.iosTap(.label("New Session"))
   TestStep.iosWaitForElementToDisappear(.labelContains("Loading projects"), timeout: 15)

   // ✅ waiting for a project item proves the list rendered
   TestStep.iosTap(.label("New Session"))
   TestStep.iosWaitForElement(.labelContains("New Terminal"), timeout: 15)
   ```

2. **Fixed wait around terminal/tmux state.** When you need to wait for the terminal to reach a known state, use `waitForTmuxDisplayMessage` / `waitForTmuxDisplayMessageNotEqual` keyed on `#{pane_title}`, `#{pane_width}x#{pane_height}`, etc., so the test moves on the instant the state lands rather than after a worst-case sleep.

Fixed waits are still appropriate when there's no observable signal — typically before a `*Screenshot` that captures a debounced/animated state (cursor blink, scroll deceleration), or between a `tmuxRunCommand` and an immediate `tmuxCapturePaneContent`. Keep those durations tight (0.3–1s).

## Element queries (iOS)

The `ElementQuery` enum matches against the iOS accessibility tree (provided by the XCUITest runner):

| Query | Matches |
|-------|---------|
| `.label("exact text")` | Exact label match |
| `.labelContains("substring")` | Label contains (case-insensitive) |
| `.role("Button")` | Role match (e.g., Button, StaticText, TextField) |
| `.identifier("id")` | Accessibility identifier match |
| `.roleAndLabelContains(role:label:)` | Both role and label substring |
| `.valueContains("text")` | Value contains |
| `.allOf([...])` | All sub-queries must match |

Role values use XCUIElement.ElementType names: Button, StaticText, TextField, Image, Window, Alert, etc.

## Making UI elements discoverable

### iOS (XCUITest runner)

Use standard SwiftUI accessibility modifiers. These map to attributes the XCUITest runner exposes via `snapshot().dictionaryRepresentation`:

```swift
Button { ... } label: { Image(systemName: "plus") }
    .accessibilityLabel("New Session")  // → ElementQuery.label("New Session")

HStack { ... }
    .accessibilityIdentifier("host-row")  // → ElementQuery.identifier("host-row")
```

For confirmation dialogs, use `roleAndLabelContains` to target buttons specifically and avoid matching dialog titles or message text:

```swift
// Dialog title: "Remove Pairing"
// Button label: "Remove MacBook Pro"
TestStep.iosTap(.roleAndLabelContains(role: "Button", label: "Remove"))
```

### macOS (TestAccessibilityServer)

The macOS app runs an in-process HTTP server (`TestAccessibilityServer` on port 18081) when launched with `--e2e-test`. The `macClickButton(titled:)` step queries this server, which searches for elements using multiple strategies:

1. **Toolbar items** — matches by `label`
2. **Sidebar/outline rows** — walks the NSView hierarchy to find `NSOutlineView` rows, then calls `accessibilityPerformPress()` on the `AXButton` inside
3. **Accessibility tree** — recursive walk via `accessibilityChildren()`, matching by `title`, `label`, `value`, or `help`

#### Toolbar buttons

SwiftUI buttons with `Label` don't expose a title in System Events. Use `.help()` which maps to the `AXHelp` attribute:

```swift
Button { ... } label: { Label("Generate Code", symbol: .key) }
    .help("Generate Pairing Code")  // discoverable by macClickButton
```

#### Sidebar rows (List items)

Sidebar rows in `List` must use `Button` (not `onTapGesture`) to be discoverable. Place `.accessibilityLabel()` on the `Button`, not on the row content — otherwise the label gets duplicated in the accessibility tree:

```swift
// Good: Button with accessibilityLabel on the button itself
Button {
    selectedPane = pane
} label: {
    PaneSidebarRow(pane: pane)
}
.buttonStyle(.plain)
.accessibilityLabel(pane.target)  // → macClickButton(titled: "session:0.0")

// Bad: onTapGesture — no AXPress action, clicks are unreliable
PaneSidebarRow(pane: pane)
    .onTapGesture { selectedPane = pane }
```

**Why Button matters:** `NSOutlineView` doesn't expose its rows through `accessibilityChildren()`, so the generic accessibility tree walker can't find them. The test server walks the NSView hierarchy instead, locates the matching row, then finds the `AXButton` inside it and calls `accessibilityPerformPress()`. Without a `Button`, there's no `AXPress` action to invoke.

## Screenshot comparison

The `iosScreenshot` and `macScreenshot` steps compare against stored baselines by default (`compare: true`). Pass `compare: false` to take a screenshot without comparison.

Screenshots are automatically numbered with a zero-padded counter (`01-`, `02-`, etc.) that resets per scenario — labels in scenarios should not include manual number prefixes.

### How it works

1. A screenshot is taken and auto-numbered (e.g. label `"home-screen"` becomes `01-home-screen.png`)
2. If no baseline exists for this label + scenario, the screenshot is saved as the new baseline and the step passes
3. If a baseline exists, a pixel-by-pixel comparison is performed
4. If the percentage of differing pixels exceeds the tolerance, the step fails and a diff image is generated

### Baseline storage

Baselines are stored under the `--baselines-dir` directory (default: `E2ETests`, relative to the project root), organized by scenario:

```
E2ETests/
├── fresh-pairing/
│   ├── 01-ios-pairing-view.png       # baseline
│   ├── 01-ios-pairing-view_diff.png  # generated on failure
│   └── 02-mac-code-generated.png
└── new-terminal/
    └── 01-new-session.png
```

Scenario names are sanitized to lowercase with spaces replaced by hyphens.

### Usage in scenarios

```swift
public enum MyScenario {
    public static let scenario = scenario("My Scenario") {
        // ... setup steps ...

        // Exact pixel match (tolerance: 0%, compare: true — both defaults)
        TestStep.iosScreenshot(label: "home-screen")

        // Allow up to 1% pixel difference (for anti-aliasing, animations, etc.)
        TestStep.macScreenshot(label: "settings-window", tolerance: 1.0)

        // Screenshot without comparison
        TestStep.iosScreenshot(label: "debug-state", compare: false)
    }
}
```

### First run (creating baselines)

On the first run, no baselines exist. Each comparison step will:
- Save the current screenshot as the baseline
- Log "Baseline created for '...'"
- Pass (no comparison to fail against)

Subsequent runs compare against these stored baselines.

### Updating baselines

To update baselines after intentional UI changes, delete the relevant baseline files:

```bash
# Delete all baselines for a scenario
rm -rf E2ETests/fresh-pairing/

# Delete a specific baseline
rm E2ETests/fresh-pairing/01-ios-pairing-view.png

# Delete all baselines
rm -rf E2ETests/
```

The next run will regenerate them.

### Diff images

When a comparison fails, a diff image is saved alongside the baseline with a `_diff` suffix. Differing pixels are highlighted in red; matching pixels are dimmed. The diff path is included in the error message.

### CLI option

```bash
CtrlxE2E --baselines-dir /path/to/baselines ...
```

## Failure screenshots

When a step fails for a reason other than a screenshot comparison (e.g. an element never appears, an assertion fails, an HTTP request errors out), the orchestrator captures a diagnostic screenshot of the running platform(s) so the report shows the UI state at the moment of failure.

- **iOS-targeted steps** (`iosTap`, `iosWaitForElement`, ...) capture the iOS simulator only.
- **macOS-targeted steps** (`macClickButton`, `macWaitForWindow`, ...) capture the targeted instance only.
- **Universal steps** (assertions, server, tmux, generic helpers) capture the iOS simulator and every running macOS instance — whichever component caused the failure is included.

Captures are best-effort: if a platform isn't running, or the screenshot itself fails, the orchestrator logs a warning and continues so the original failure is still surfaced. The PNGs are saved alongside scenario screenshots as `failure-step-NN-<target>.png` and uploaded to the results repository's content-addressable image store.

## Test report generation

The `e2e-report.sh` script runs all E2E scenarios, collects results and screenshots,
and publishes a report to an explicitly configured results repository. Set
`RESULTS_REPO=OWNER/results`, `RESULTS_REPO_URL=<git URL>`, or pass `--results-repo`.
No upstream repository is used by default.

### How it works

1. Gathers git metadata (branch, commit, PR number) from the current Ctrlx checkout
2. Ensures a clone of the results repository exists as a sibling folder (`../CtrlxTestResults`)
3. Runs `e2e-test.sh` with `--json-output` to get structured step-level results
4. Syncs the results repo to the latest remote **right before writing results** (not at startup), then copies screenshots into a **content-addressable image store** (`images/<sha256>.png`) — identical images are stored once
5. Generates a `report.json` with metadata and per-scenario/per-step results (including screenshot hashes)
6. Updates `results/index.json` with a summary of all runs (most recent first)
7. Commits and pushes everything to the results repository, retrying with a rebase if a concurrent run pushed first (the index is regenerated on conflict)

> **Concurrency note:** Step 4 deliberately syncs the remote *after* the (long) test run rather than at startup. When several VMs run the report concurrently, syncing at startup would leave the whole test run as a window in which a sibling could push, making the final push race and fail. Syncing immediately before the commit — plus the rebase-and-retry in step 7 — keeps concurrent runs from clobbering each other.

### Usage

```bash
# Run all e2e tests and publish report
./scripts/e2e-report.sh

# Skip build (reuse previously built artifacts)
./scripts/e2e-report.sh --skip-build

# Run a specific scenario
./scripts/e2e-report.sh --scenario "Fresh Pairing"

# Custom results repo URL or local path
./scripts/e2e-report.sh --results-repo git@github.com:user/MyResults.git
./scripts/e2e-report.sh --results-dir /path/to/local/results
```

All `e2e-test.sh` options (`--skip-build`, `--sim-name`, `--scenario`, etc.) are passed through.

### Results repository structure

The results repository is a separate git repository that stores test results and
screenshots. To use the report viewer, provide its static HTML and `serve.sh`;
these are not provisioned by the report script.

```
CtrlxTestResults/
├── index.html                        # Single-page viewer app
├── serve.sh                          # Local HTTP server for viewing
├── images/                           # Content-addressable image store
│   ├── <sha256>.png                  # Deduplicated screenshots
│   └── ...
└── results/
    ├── index.json                    # All runs (most recent first)
    ├── 2026-02-15_14-30-00_main/
    │   ├── report.json               # Metadata + scenario results
    │   └── results.json              # Raw step-level output
    └── 2026-02-14_10-00-00_feature-branch/
        ├── report.json
        └── results.json
```

Each `report.json` contains:
- **metadata** — branch, commit, commit message, PR number/URL, timestamp
- **scenarios** — array of scenario results, each with steps that include screenshot hashes (`imageHash`, `baselineHash`, `diffHash`), pass/fail status, and diff percentages. Failed non-comparison steps additionally include `failureScreenshots`: an array of `{ target, imageHash }` entries for each captured platform.

### Viewing results

```bash
cd ../CtrlxTestResults && ./serve.sh
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

The viewer shows a list of runs with pass/fail status and lets you drill into individual scenarios and screenshot comparisons.

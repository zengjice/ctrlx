/// Builds the Codex CLI `-c key=value` launch overrides that point Codex's
/// OpenTelemetry export at the Mac-local OTLP/JSON receiver (issue #602).
///
/// **Why `-c` and not env vars or the config file.** Codex's supported OTEL
/// opt-in is its `[otel]` configuration, not Claude's environment-only setup.
/// `TmuxService`'s Claude env injection therefore isn't enough to enable Codex
/// export. Also, `otel` is on Codex's project-local config denylist, so a
/// repo-local `.codex/config.toml` is ignored for OTEL. The remaining surfaces
/// are the user's global `~/.codex/config.toml` (persistent, risks corrupting
/// the user's own config) and the CLI runtime-override layer (`-c`). We use
/// `-c`: the runtime layer is explicitly *exempt* from the `otel` denylist
/// (verified against codex-rs `config/src/loader/mod.rs`
/// `PROJECT_LOCAL_CONFIG_DENYLIST`, whose comment notes these settings "are
/// still supported from user, system, managed, and runtime config layers"), and
/// it is ephemeral — nothing is written to the user's global config, so a
/// CtrlX launch can never corrupt or persist changes to the user's Codex
/// setup. UI launches and the new-terminal zsh integration use this SAME
/// argument generator. Ordinary shells outside CtrlX remain untouched.
///
/// The emitted settings mirror the `[otel]` schema Codex deserializes (verified
/// against codex-rs `config/src/types.rs` `OtelConfigToml` / `OtelExporterKind`,
/// a kebab-case externally-tagged enum):
/// ```toml
/// [otel]
/// exporter = { otlp-http = { endpoint = "<base>/v1/logs", protocol = "json" } }
/// metrics_exporter = "none"
/// log_user_prompt = false
/// ```
/// expressed as dotted-path overrides (Codex merges them into one `otel` table).
///
/// - **logs only**: the `exporter` (log) channel is the only one that carries
///   `conversation.id` — Codex metrics omit it (openai/codex#15905), so they
///   can't be joined to a pane. `metrics_exporter = "none"` both reflects that
///   and prevents enabling Codex's default Statsig metrics export to OpenAI.
/// - **protocol = json**: so the existing OTLP/JSON `OTLPReceiver` is reused
///   unchanged.
/// - **log_user_prompt = false**: Codex's default, set explicitly so no prompt
///   content ever leaves the process (same privacy posture as #597).
